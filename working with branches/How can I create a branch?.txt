You might expect that you would use git branch to create a branch, and indeed this is possible.
However, the most common thing you want to do is to create a branch then switch to that branch.

In the previous exercise, you used git checkout branch-name to switch to a branch.
To create a branch then switch to it in one step, you add a -b flag, calling git checkout -b branch-name,

The contents of the new branch are initially identical to the contents of the original. Once you start making changes, they only affect the new branch.


1
You are in the master branch of the dental repository. Create a new branch called deleting-report.

2
Use git rm report.txt to delete the report.

3
Commit your changes with a log message.

4
Use git diff with appropriate arguments to compare the master branch with the new state of the deleting-report branch.
