Suppose you have made changes to a file, then decide you want to undo them. Your text editor may be able to do this,
but a more reliable way is to let Git do the work. The command:

git checkout -- filename
will discard the changes that have not yet been staged.
(The double dash -- must be there to separate the git checkout command from the names of the file or files you want to recover.)

Use this command carefully: once you discard changes in this way, they are gone forever.
