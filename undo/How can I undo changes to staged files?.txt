How can I undo changes to staged files?
At the start of this chapter you saw that git reset will unstage files that you previously staged using git add. By combining git reset with git checkout, 
you can undo changes to a file that you staged changes to. The syntax is as follows.

git reset HEAD path/to/file
git checkout -- path/to/file
(You may be wondering why there are two commands for re-setting changes.
The answer is that unstaging a file and undoing changes are both special cases of more powerful Git operations that you have not yet seen.)
