The complement of git pull is git push, which pushes the changes you have made locally into a remote repository. The most common way to use it is:

git push remote-name branch-name
which pushes the contents of your branch branch-name into a branch with the same name in the remote repository associated with remote-name.
It's possible to use different branch names at your end and the remote's end, but doing this quickly becomes confusing:
it's almost always better to use the same names for branches across repositories.
